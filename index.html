    <p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
    internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
    Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why..</p>

    <p>1.You can understand what is going on 'under the hood' </p>
    <p>2. Not have to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website!</p>
    <p>3. It's fun!</p>

    <em><h3>What do you need to create a website? </em></h3>

    <p>Not much!</p>
    <li>A computer (always a good start) </li>
    <li>A text editor (I am using atom) </li>
    <li>A web browser (I am using chrome) </li>
    <li> Some HTML, CSS and JS files </li>

    <p>Follow my progress on github</p>
